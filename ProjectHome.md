Slim3 is a full-stack MVC framework optimized for Google App Engine/Java.

Our main concept is "Simple" and "Less Is More".
"Less is more" means simplicity and clarity lead to good design.

80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.
We concentrate all our energies into 20% of the causes.
Programmers can resolve the other issues without framework constraints.

We want to get rid of complex and wasted features from your applications and our framework.
As a result, we will slim down.
